## Special symbols

Some special symbols are available that can be used inline with text:

| LaTeX code | Formatted output |
| ---------- | ---------------- |
| `\versicle` | ℣ | 
| `\response` | ℟ | 
| `\cross` | ✠ |
| `\scross` | + |
| `\gl` | « | 
| `\gr` | » | 

## Special commands

There are also some special commands to fine-tune formatting when needed (usually these are controlled by LaTeX, so the below should be used sparingly):

* `\blankline` forces a blank line
* `\deleteline` deletes an empty line's space
* `\tab` forces an indent
